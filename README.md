# Solidity Challenges

Welcome to the Solidity Challenges Repository! üéâ

This repository is designed to help Solidity developers sharpen their skills through practical challenges. Each challenge focuses on a specific aspect of Solidity and is paired with a discussion thread where you can share your solutions, learn from others, and engage with the community.

<br/>

> There's just one rule here: avoid copying directly from ChatGPT. While it's an invaluable tool, let's strive for more authenticity in our responses.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each challenge is contained within its own folder, following this structure:

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenges/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge_01/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge.sol
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge_02/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge.sol
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

```

### Folder Contents

- **Challenge.sol**: The file presenting the challenge. It typically contains a problem statement or partially implemented contract that needs completion or fixing.
- **README.md**: A description of the challenge, including the problem statement, constraints, and hints to guide you through solving the challenge.

---

## üî• Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Solidity**: Ensure you have Solidity installed. The recommended version is 0.8.x or higher.
  - Solidity using [solc](https://soliditylang.org/installing-solidity.html)
  - Solidity using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- **Node.js and npm**: For testing and running Solidity code locally using frameworks like Hardhat or Foundry.

### Running the Challenges

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/passandscore/solidity-challenges.git
   cd solidity-challenges
   ```

2. **Explore a Challenge**

   Navigate to the desired challenge folder:

   ```bash
   cd Challenges/Challenge_01
   ```

3. **Compile and Test the Challenge**

   You can use tools like Remix IDE or a local development environment to compile and test your Solidity code. For Remix:

   - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Load the `Challenge.sol` file.
   - Compile and deploy the contract.

## Providing Solutions

By default we do not provide solutions to the challenges. This is to encourage you to think critically and solve the challenges on your own. If you have a unique or optimized solution, you can submit a pull request to share it with the community. If the community finds your solution valuable, it will be merged into the repository.

## üõ† Submitting Your Own Challenge

We encourage the community to contribute by submitting new challenges. Follow these steps to submit your challenge:

1. **Create a New Folder**

   Create a new folder named `New_Challenge`.

   ```bash
   mkdir New_Challenge
   cd New_Challenge
   ```

2. **Add Challenge File**

   - Create a `Challenge.sol` file with the challenge.

3. **Write a Description**

   Add a `README.md` file within your challenge folder describing the challenge, including:

   - **Problem Statement**: What needs to be solved.
   - **Constraints**: Any specific constraints or requirements.
   - **Hints**: Optional hints to guide others.

4. **Open a Pull Request**

   - Fork this repository.
   - Create a new branch from `main`.
   - Add your challenge and solution.
   - Open a pull request to merge your changes.

### Example Challenge Description

**README.md** inside `Challenge_01`:

```markdown
# Challenge 01

## Problem Statement

You need to copy an array of structs from `calldata` to `storage`. However, directly assigning a `calldata` array to a `storage` array results in a compilation error.

**Task**:
- Refactor the given contract to manually copy the struct array from `calldata` to `storage`.
- Provide your solution and comments in the Discussion for this challenge.

**Constraints**:
- Use Solidity 0.8.x or higher.
```
