## Welcome to the Solidity Challenges Repository! üéâ

This repository is designed to help Solidity developers sharpen their skills through practical challenges. Each challenge focuses on a specific aspect of Solidity and is paired with a discussion thread where you can share your solutions, learn from others, and engage with the community.

<br/>

> There's just one rule here: avoid copying directly from ChatGPT. While it's an invaluable tool, let's strive for more authenticity in our responses.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each challenge is contained within its own folder, following this structure:

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenges/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge_01/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge.sol
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Solution.sol
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge_02/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Challenge.sol
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Solution.sol
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

```

### Folder Contents

- **Challenge.sol**: The file presenting the challenge. It typically contains a problem statement or partially implemented contract that needs completion or fixing.
- **Solution.sol**: The solution to a challenge will be revealed in the next challenge. You can submit your solutions in the Discussions section.
- **README.md**: A description of the challenge, including the problem statement, constraints, and hints to guide you through solving the challenge.

---

## üî• Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Solidity**: Ensure you have Solidity installed. The recommended version is 0.8.x or higher.
  - Solidity using [solc](https://soliditylang.org/installing-solidity.html)
  - Solidity using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
- **Node.js and npm**: For testing and running Solidity code locally using frameworks like Hardhat or Foundry.

### Running the Challenges

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/passandscore/solidity-challenges.git
   cd solidity-challenges
   ```

2. **Explore a Challenge**

   Navigate to the desired challenge folder:

   ```bash
   cd challenges/Challenge_01
   ```

3. **Compile and Test the Challenge**

   You can use tools like Remix IDE or a local development environment to compile and test your Solidity code. For Remix:

   - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Load the `Challenge.sol` file.
   - Compile and deploy the contract.

## Providing Solutions

After working on a challenge, you can share your solution in the Discussions section. This is a great way to get feedback, learn from others, and engage with the community. We encourage you to provide detailed explanations of your solutions to help others understand your thought process. We will be revealing the official solutions in the subsequent challenges.

## üõ† Submitting Your Own Challenge

We encourage the community to contribute by submitting new challenges. Follow these steps to submit your challenge:

1. **Create a New Folder**

    - Create a new folder named `New_Challenge`.

   ```bash
   mkdir new_challenge
   cd new_challenge
   ```

2. **Add Challenge File**

     - Create a `Challenge.sol` file with the challenge.

3. **Write a Description**

     - Add a `README.md` file within your challenge folder describing the challenge, including:
  
     - **Problem Statement**: What needs to be solved.
     - **Constraints**: Any specific constraints or requirements.
     - **Hints**: Optional hints to guide others.

4. **Open a Pull Request**

     - Fork this repository.
     - Create a new branch from `main`.
     - Add your challenge and solution.
     - Open a pull request to merge your changes.

### Example Challenge Description

**README.md** inside `Challenge_01`:

```markdown
# Challenge 01

## Problem Statement

You need to copy an array of structs from `calldata` to `storage`. However, directly assigning a `calldata` array to a `storage` array results in a compilation error.

**Task**:
- Refactor the given contract to manually copy the struct array from `calldata` to `storage`.
- Provide your solution and comments in the Discussion for this challenge.

**Constraints**:
- Use Solidity 0.8.x or higher.
```
